# Android to iOS Health CSV

This set of scripts, pulls your CSV files generated from Health Sync Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.appyhapps.healthsync&hl=en-us), converts them to Health CSV Importer iOS (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-csv-importer/id1275959806) compatible files and reuploads them combined to a drive folder of choice via folder_ID. It does some versioning, so you can run it whenever you like then sync the new output file without duplicates in theory.
