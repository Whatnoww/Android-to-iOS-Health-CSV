# Android to iOS Health CSV

This set of scripts, pulls your CSV files generated from Health Sync (the Android app), converts them to Health CSV Importer (iOS app) compatible files and reuploads them combined to a drive folder of choice via folder_ID. It does some versioning, so you can run it whenever you like then sync the new output file without duplicates in theory.
